                                <p> This study is about analyzing data from the United States Small Business 
                                    Administration (SBA) that gives banks guarantees to give loans to startups
                                     There have been many success stories of start-ups receiving SBA loan guarantees 
                                     such as FedEx and Apple Computer. However, there have also been stories of small 
                                     businesses and/or start-ups that have defaulted on their SBA-guaranteed loans , 
                                     So our job is to find the loan that the owner can not repay to reject that loan 
                                     and find the loans that the owner can pay to accept it,and the way to do that is 
                                     by building model can predict default in loan.</p>

                                     of the largest companies in Germany and the world. i have created a model that enables the company to predict car prices, and this matter helps decision makers in companies to know what type of cars achieve
                                    more profits and what cars should be avoided.</p>

                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi My name is Mohamed Elhilal Tekouk, and I am currently pursuing a major in <span>Statistics and Data Science</span> at <span>ENSSEA</span> Algeria.
                My coursework has equipped me with a strong foundation in statistics, data analysis, and machine
                learning. I have had the opportunity to work on several data science projects, allowing me to apply
                my knowledge in practical scenarios. Additionally, my passion for data science led me to participate
                in datathons, where my team emerged as winners in the last competition organized by our school.
                Proficiency in Python and R enables me to effectively analyze data and develop robust models. While I am proficient in both languages, I find that R allows me to focus more on the data itself rather than the coding process. Recently, I have been expanding my knowledge through various machine learning courses, emphasizing the functionality of packages, particularly in R in data camp and coursera plateforms . I am currently engrossed in an MLOps course to understand how to deploy and maintain machine learning models effectively.
